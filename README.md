# Ride Hailing App API

![Mooving app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DAVFoundation/ride-hailing-api/master/.github/readme_header.png)

DAV (Decentralized Autonomous Vehicles) is a non-profit foundation working to build an open-source infrastructure for autonomous vehicles (cars, drones, trucks, robots, boats, and all the service providers around them) to communicate and transact with each other over blockchain.

One of the first projects being built by the DAV Foundation is a decentralized ride hailing app. This app connects drivers and passengers directly to each other. The repository you are looking at is the API that drives this ride hailing app for both passengers and drivers.
